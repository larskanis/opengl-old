* Added support for many more OpenGL extensions
* Support for Ruby 1.9.0+ (requires mkrf 0.2.3)
* Ton of bugfixes.<br><br>

==== API Changes
* Boolean functions/parameters was changed to ruby true/false instead of GL\_TRUE / GL\_FALSE, which remains for compatibility
* glGet\* functions now returns x instead of [x] when returning only one value
* Functions operating on packed strings (glTexture, gl\*Pointer etc.) now also accepts ruby arrays directly
* Matrix handling functions now also accepts instances of Matrix class, or any class that can be converted to array
* glUniform\*v and glUniformmatrix\*v now does not require 'count' parameter, they will calculate it from length of passed array
* glCallLists needs type specifier (previously was forced to GL_BYTE)
* On ruby 1.9, glut keyboard callback returns char ("x") instead of integer so using 'if key == ?x' works on both 1.8 and 1.9
