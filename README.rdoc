== Description

An OpenGL wrapper for Ruby.  ruby-opengl contains bindings for OpenGL and the
GLU and GLUT libraries.

== Features and Problems

* available for Windows, Linux, OS-X

== Synopsis

  require 'opengl'
  FIX (code sample of usage)

== Requirements

* Ruby 1.9.2+
  *  see https://github.com/larskanis/opengl/tree/0.7 for Ruby 1.8.x compatible branch
* proper OpenGL, GLU and (free-)GLUT development files installed

== Install

  gem install opengl --pre

== Developers

After checking out the source, run:

  $ rake newb

This task will install any missing dependencies, run the tests/specs,
and generate the RDoc.

== Cross compiling for Windows

Using rake-compiler a cross compiled opengl gem can be build on a Linux or MacOS X
host for the win32 platform. The generated gem is statically linked against
libfreeglut. Freeglut is downloaded and compiled from the sources.
There are no runtime dependencies to any but the standard Windows
DLLs.

Install mingw32 or w64 using the instructions in rake-compiler's README.
For Debian/Ubuntu it is <tt>apt-get install gcc-mingw-w64</tt> .

Download and cross compile ruby 1.9 for win32 with:

  rake-compiler cross-ruby VERSION=1.9.3-p0

Download and cross compile opengl for win32:

  rake cross native gem

or with custom versions:

  rake cross native gem RUBY_CC_VERSION=1.9.3 LIBFREEGLUT_VERSION=2.8.0

If everything works, there should be ruby-opengl-VERSION-x86-mingw32.gem in the pkg
directory.
